= Just a Project Generator

*Alpha State*

A project generator using #link("https://github.com/casey/just")[just]

To use this tool, you may need the knowledge of #link("https://github.com/casey/just")[just]
and shell script (However, `just` let you run script using many other languages).

== Features

+ fully customizable
+ simple and there is no extra grammar you need to learn (if you use `just` and write shell script)
+ shell completion support
+ use languages and tools you know and you like (e.g. #link("https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate")[cargo-generate] for rust project)

== Limitations

+ Runtime variables (like current filename, current parent directory name) are not shareable. You need to regain and process the variable values though command `fd -t f -x sh -c "echo '{}'"` or something else. However, if you do want to do this stuff, remember the replacement of text has order, so you can write functions like `::foo(::jpg.author.name::)::`. However, it's quite limited.

+ Don't support control flow and functions in templates. You are encouraged to process variables in your justfile. If you want to have those advanced stuffs, it's recommended to use other tools like #link("https://github.com/mattrobenolt/jinja2-cli")[jinja2-cli] to pre-process template first in your justfile recipe. In this case, you can think JPG is just a command runner. 

== Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ziqi-Yang/jpg
cd jpg
sudo just install
just install_completion
just check-deps
just create-example-user-configuration
```

You can execute command `sudo just uninstall` (and `just uninstall_completion`) to uninstall JPG.

== Quick Run

After running `just create-example-user-configuration` at the _Installation_ step, you have example configuration at the
`jpg` folder at the user-specific configuration directory (for Linux, normally it's `~/.config`). Take a look at the files inside it
and run the following command to see the effect.
```bash
cd /tmp
# using python template (example template) to create a project named `test`
jpg python test
```

== Override Options

You can see the full list of JPG variables using command `jpg config -a`. Other options for `jpg config` can be viewed by command `jpg` or
`jpg help`

You can customize it in a file called `config` (if you use example configuration) at your JPG user configuration directory. This
file follows the style of `.env` file. Here is an example:
```
JPG_V_USER_NAME="Meow King"
```

== Create your project templates

Create your template inside `JPG_TEMPLATES_DIR` directory(by default, it's the `template` directory under your JPG user configuration directory).

Also take a look at the example `main.just` file at your JPG user configuration directory. You can utilize builtin
functions defined defined in #link("./lib.just")[lib.just] file.

=== Easy to use TUI libraries

If you write your justfile recipe in languages like `python`, `golang`, etc. You may want to use these TUI libraries:
+ #link("https://github.com/Textualize/rich")[rich] `python`
+ #link("https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea")[bubbletea] `golang`

== FAQ

=== How can share my template with others?

+ Upload your template to an online open source project hosting service. (it's better to name it using `jpg-` prefix).
+ Share your corresponding justfile recipe. \
  Example recipe:
  ```just
  python name: && (jpg-replace-builtin name)
      git clone https://github.com/Ziqi-Yang/jpg.git name
  ```
  Or you can share your justfile (only with the related parts). Others can import it.

=== I don't want to store my secret in `~/.config/jpg/config` file. Where should I store my secret?

Suppose you have make a git repo for synchronizing your templates. Since `config` file is
also used to change the values of JPG variables, it's not recommended to store your
secrets. There are possibly two approaches:

+ create another justfile to store your secrets into variables, import the justfile in
  your `main.just` and put the filename into your `.gitignore`.
+ Store it in another environment file. In your related justfile recipes, write this: \
  ```just
  a:
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    source <path>/.env
  ```

=== Why JPG uses `::variable_name::` as its builtin template style, instead of something like `{{variable_name}}`?

First pls note that you can change the builtin template style by setting variables `JPG_TEMP_BEGIN_SYM` and `JPG_TEMP_END_SYM`.

==== Why not `{{variable_name}}`

+ collision with `just`'s templating style (i.e. `{{just_variable}}`). Also, currently
  `just` (1.25.2) will also interpret all `{{` characters as variable start. So if JPG
  uses `{{variable_name}}` style, then we needs to write stuffs like `{{{{variable_name}}}}`.
    
+ `jpg-replace-builtin` function uses `fd -x` (or `fd --exec`), and `fd -x` will interpret
  `{{` as `{` (it's its own style of escaping `{` character).
  
+ If JPG uses `{{variable_name}}` style, then combining with the first caveat, we need to
  write stuffs like `{{{{{{{{variable_name}}}}`


+ Avoid collision with popular template languages like `jinja`.

==== Why not `[[variable_name]]`

`jpg-replace-builtin` uses `sed` (and you may also want to use it), and `sed` can only
handle regexp replacement, such that we need to escape `[`.

==== Example Script File explaining the choose of different templating styles

For template:
```
Python 3.11.8
{{PYTHON_VERSION}}
{{PYTHON_VERSION}}
```

We write this script:

```just
V_PYTHON_VERSION := "{{{{PYTHON_VERSION}}}}"
# create a python project (example)
python1 name: (jpg-copy-template name "python") && (jpg-replace-builtin name)
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    # use 'set -eux' to print the steps
    set -eu
    
    PYTHON_VERSION=$(python3 --version)
    
    # 1. 'just' will replace variables inside double brackets. And it will
    # also replace any 2x'{' in script to '{' (but not '}}'). use '{{{{' to escape.
    # example: see `V_PYTHON_VERSION` variable
    
    # 2. then fd will replace things like '{}' (see '--exec' help), and treat
    #   2x'{' as '{', 2x'}' as '}' (escape).

    # 3. since we are in sh shell script, variables with syntax like ${} will be
    #   replaced with the variables we defined previous in this justfile block
    
    # 4. to use variables inside the inner sh block, we need to escape
    # dollar character like '\${HOME}'. Note only variables in double quote will
    # be interpreted by sh.
    
    fd -t f -x sh -c "
      sed -i \
        -e \"s&Python 3.11.8&${PYTHON_VERSION}&g\" \
        -e \"s&{{V_PYTHON_VERSION}}&${PYTHON_VERSION}&g\" \
        -e \"s&{{{{{{{{PYTHON_VERSION}}}}&${PYTHON_VERSION}&g\" \
        '{}'
    "
```
